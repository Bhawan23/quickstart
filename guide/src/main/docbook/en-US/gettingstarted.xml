   <title>Getting started with JBoss AS 7</title>

   <para>
      To run the examples with the provided build scripts, you'll need the following:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>the JBoss AS 7 distribution zip, which contains the examples</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>Maven 3, to build and deploy the examples</para>

   </itemizedlist>
   
   <para>
      Follow <link linkend="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">the offical Maven installation guide</link>
      if you don't already have Maven 3 installed. You can check which version of Maven you have installed (if any) by 
      running <literal>mvn --version</literal>. If you see a version newer than 3.0.0, you are ready to go.
   </para>

   <para>
      Now, download JBoss AS <link linkend="TODO">from the JBoss AS 7 page</link>.

      <para>
         JBoss AS 7 offers the ability to manage multiple AS instances from a single control point. A collection
         of such servers are referred to as members of a "domain", with a single Domain Controller process acting
         as the management control point. Domains can span multiple physical (or virtual) machines, with all AS instances
         on a given host under the control of a Host Controller process. The Host Controllers interact with the Domain Controller
         to control the lifecycle of the AS instances running on that host and to assist the Domain Controller in managing them.
      </para>
      <para>
         JBoss AS 7 also offers a standalone mode, which is perfect for a single server. We use this throughout the quickstart
         examples.

      <title>Installing and starting JBoss AS 7 on Linux, Unix or Mac OS X</title>
      
      <para>
         First, we need to choose a location for JBoss AS to live. By default, JBoss AS 7 will be extracted
         into <literal>jboss-7.x.x.x</literal> (where 7.x.x.x matches the version you downloaded):
      </para>
         
      <programlisting>unzip jboss-7.x.x.x.zip</programlisting>
      
      <para>
         We now need to set the <literal>JBOSS_HOME</literal> environment variable:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>cd jboss-7.x.x.x
export JBOSS_HOME=`pwd`</programlisting>
      
      <para>
         Finally, let's start JBoss AS 7 in standalone mode:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh</programlisting>
      
      <tip>
         <para>
            If you want to stop JBoss AS, simply press <literal>Crtl-C</literal> whilst the terminal has focus.
         </para>
      </tip>
      
      <para>
         That's it, JBoss AS 7 is installed and running!

         into <literal>jboss-7.x.x.x</literal> (where 7.x.x.x matches the version you downloaded). Unzip JBoss AS
         using your tool of choice.
