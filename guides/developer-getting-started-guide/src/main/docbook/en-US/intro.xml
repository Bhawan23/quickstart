      This guide will walk you through installing and starting up JBoss AS 7. It will then introduce
      key features of the Java EE 6 (Web Profile) programming model, of which JBoss AS 7 is a certified
      implementation.

      <title>Java EE 6</title>
      <para>
         The Java EE 6 platform offers developers the ability to write distributed, transactional and portable
         applications quickly and easily. We class applications that require these capabilities "enterprise
         applications". These applications must be fast, secure and reliable.  
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Java EE has always offered strong messaging (JMS), transactional (JTA) and resource (JCA) capabilities
         as well as exposing webservices via SOAP (JAX-WS). Java EE 5 started a radical shift for the 
         programming model, offering a powerful, declarative and lightweight object-relational mapper (JPA) and 
         annotation-driven, lightweight access to enterprise services (EJB 3). Java EE 6 added a type-safe,
         loosely coupled programming model (CDI), declarative validation of constraints (Bean Validation) and
         RESTful webservices (JAX-RS) to produce a complete, modern development environment.

      JBoss AS 7 departs from the familiar structure of previous JBoss AS versions, so we recommend 
      all developers follow the steps in <xref linkend="gettingstarted"/> to install and start up the
      application server for the first time. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
      JBoss AS 7 comes with a series of quickstarts aimed to get you up to writing applications with 
      minimal fuss. We recommend that you work through the quickstarts in the order they are presented
      in this guide, however if you have previous experience with Java EE 6, you may wish to skip some 
      or all of the quickstarts:

               If you have previously developed applications using technologies such as JSF or Wicket, and
               EJB or Spring, you may wish to skip this quickstart.
