   <title>Getting started with JBoss AS 7</title>

   <para>
      To run the examples with the provided build scripts, you'll need the following:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>the JBoss AS 7 distribution zip, which contains the examples</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>Maven 3, to build and deploy the examples</para>
      </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   
   <para>
      Follow <link linkend="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">the offical Maven installation guide</link>
      if you don't already have Maven 3 installed. You can check which version of Maven you have installed (if any) by 
      running <literal>mvn --version</literal>. If you see a version newer than 3.0.0, you are ready to go.
   </para>
   
   <para>
      You can also deploy the examples using your favourite IDE. We provide instructions for using Eclipse
      only.
   </para>

   <para>
      Now, download JBoss AS <link linkend="TODO">from the JBoss AS 7 page</link>.
   </para>
   
   <note>
      <para>
         JBoss AS 7 offers the ability to manage multiple AS instances from a single control point. A collection
         of such servers are referred to as members of a "domain", with a single Domain Controller process acting
         as the management control point. Domains can span multiple physical (or virtual) machines, with all AS instances
         on a given host under the control of a Host Controller process. The Host Controllers interact with the Domain Controller
         to control the lifecycle of the AS instances running on that host and to assist the Domain Controller in managing them.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         JBoss AS 7 also offers a standalone mode, which is perfect for a single server. We use this throughout the quickstart
         examples.

      <title>Installing and starting JBoss AS 7 on Linux, Unix or Mac OS X</title>
      
      <para>
         First, we need to choose a location for JBoss AS to live. By default, JBoss AS 7 will be extracted
         into <literal>jboss-7.x.x.x</literal> (where 7.x.x.x matches the version you downloaded):
      </para>
         
      <programlisting>unzip jboss-7.x.x.x.zip</programlisting>
      
      <para>
         Now, let's start JBoss AS 7 in standalone mode:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>jboss-7.x.x.x/bin/standalone.sh</programlisting>
      
      <tip>
         <para>
            If you want to stop JBoss AS, simply press <literal>Crtl-C</literal> whilst the terminal has focus.
         </para>
      </tip>
      
      <para>
         That's it, JBoss AS 7 is installed and running! Visit <ulink url="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</ulink>
         to check the server has started properly.
      </para>
      
      <tip>
         <para>
            You can find the server log for standalone instances in 
            <literal>jboss-7.x.x.x/standalone/log/server.log</literal>. The admin guide covers more on configuring
            logging.

      <title>Installing and starting JBoss AS on Windows</title>
      
      <para>
         First, we need to choose a location for JBoss AS to live. By default, JBoss AS 7 will be extracted
         into <literal>jboss-7.x.x.x</literal> (where 7.x.x.x matches the version you downloaded). Unzip JBoss AS
         using your tool of choice.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Finally, let's start JBoss AS 7 in standalone mode. Locate your JBoss AS installation and run
         <literal>standalone.bat</literal> located in <literal>bin</literal>.

      <title>Starting JBoss AS from Eclipse with JBoss Tools</title>
      
      <para>
         You may choose to use Eclipse rather than the command line to run JBoss AS, and to deploy the examples.
         If you don't wish to use Eclipse, you should skip this section.
     </para>
      
      <note>
         <para>
            In order to use JBoss AS 7 from Eclipse, you must first install JBoss AS for your operating system as
            described in <xref linkend="install.unix"/> or <xref linkend="install.windows"/>.
         </para>
      </note>
      
      <para>
         In order use JBoss AS 7 from Eclipse, you'll need Eclipse Indigo (Eclipse 3.7) and JBoss Tools 3.3 M2
         or newer. If you want to run the quickstarts from Eclipse, you will also need m2eclipse. You can find 
         instructions for installing Eclipse, m2eclipse and JBoss Tools <link linkend="TODO">on the JBoss AS site.</link>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Having successfully installed and started Eclipse, we need to add our JBoss AS 7 instance to it. First,

      </mediaobject>
      
      <para>
         Now, let's start JBoss AS 7 from Eclipse. If you previously started JBoss AS 7 from the command line,
         you should stop it there first.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         First, we need to make sure the <literal>Server</literal> tab is on view. Open the

      <para>
         You should see the <literal>Server View</literal> appear with the JBoss AS 7 server:

         Now, we can start the server. Right click on the server in the <literal>Server</literal> view,
         and select <literal>Start</literal>:

         <para>
            If you want to debug your application, you can simply select <literal>Debug</literal> rather than
            <literal>Start</literal>. This will start the server in debug mode, and automatically attach the
            Eclipse debugger.
         </para>
      </tip>
      
      <para>
         You'll see the server output in the <literal>Console</literal>:
